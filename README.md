## API

### 1. Index Generator

Generate an index of stocks based on market cap.

```python
def IndexGenerator(arrayOfStocks):
    sum = sum of market cap of all the stocks mentioned in this array
    keyValuePair = {}
    for stock in arrayOfStocks:
        keyValuePair[stock.symbol] = (stock.marketCap / sum) * 100
    return keyValuePair
```

### 2. Invested Amount in Index

Generate a portfolio based on invested amount and index.

```python
def InvestedAmountInIndex(index, moneyToInvest):
    portfolio = {}
    for stock, weight in index.items():
        portfolio[stock] = (moneyToInvest * weight / 100) / stock.currentMarketPrice
    return portfolio
```

### 3. Plot Chart (Overloading)

Generate a chart for a stock.

```python
def PlotChart(symbol, time):
    # chart generating library (needs research and development)
    return chart from today - time, today

def PlotChart(symbol, date1, date2):
    # chart generating library (needs research and development)
    return chart from date1, date2
```

    for stock in listOfStocks:
        if up:
            if (stock.currentPrice / stock.allTimeHighPrice) >= (1 - percentage / 100):
                result.append(stock)
        else:
            if (stock.currentPrice / stock.allTimeHighPrice) <= (percentage / 100):
                result.append(stock)
    return result
```

### 5. High Teller

                result.append(stock)
        else:
            if (stock.currentPrice / stock.highPriceInTimeframe(timeframe)) <= (percentage / 100):
                result.append(stock)
    return result
```

### 6. All-Time Low Teller

Get stocks near their all-time low price.

```python

            if (stock.currentPrice / stock.allTimeLowPrice) <= (percentage / 100):
                result.append(stock)
    return result
```

### 7. Low Teller
